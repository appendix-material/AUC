# AUC Values for Eight Technological Proximity Measures
The four tables contain the detailed result data from our analyses of the historical diversification of all the 76,326 inventors and 15,283 assignees with >= 30 patents in the total US patent database through 29 September 2020, across 3-digit CPC classes and 4-digit CPC subclasses. The table reports 1) the AUC values corresponding to the 8 technological proximity measures, 2) the relatively best technological proximity measure, 3) the total number of patents, and 4) the total number of classes or subclasses of each inventor and assignee in the database.

Several assignees and inventors have an extreme AUC value of 0 or 1. AUC equals to 0, when the innovation agent never diversified from its initial technological fields, which are the classes or subclasses of the agentâ€™s earliest patent. AUC equals to 1, when the innovation agent always diversified into the most proximate white-space fields to its/his/her prior positions.
