# AUC Values for Eight Technological Proximity Measures
The four tables contain the detailed result data from our analyses of the historical diversification of all the 76,326 inventors and 15,283 assignees with >= 30 patents in the patent database, across 3-digit CPC classes and 4-digit CPC subclasses. The table reports the 1) corresponding AUC values of the 8 technological proximity measures, 2) the relatively best technological proximity measure, the total number of patents, and total number of classes or subclasses of each inventor and assignee in the database.

Several assignees and inventors have an extreme AUC value of 0 or 1. AUC equals to 0, when all patents of the innovation agent belong to a single class or subclass, i.e., the agent never diversified. AUC equals to 1, when the innovation agent always diversified into the most proximate white-space fields to its/his/her prior positions.
