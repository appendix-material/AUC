# AUC

The two tables contain the corresponding AUC values of the 8 technological proximity measures for all the 76,326 inventors and 15,283 assignees analysed in this research, highlight the best technological proximity measure for each of the inventors and assignees. The tables also report the total numbers of patents and classes or subclasses of each inventor and assignee.

Please note that, several assignees and inventors have extreme AUC values of 0 or 1. AUC equals to 0 when all patents of the innovation agent belong to a single class/subclass. That is, the agent never diversified. AUC equals to 1 when the agent always diversified into the most proximate white-space fields to its/his/her prior positions.
